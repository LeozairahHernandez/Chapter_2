# Creating a Hello World App
In this chapter taught me how to make a simple "Hello World" app with Flutter, marking an important first step in learning Flutter development. It walked me through setting up a Flutter project using tools like Android Studio, IntelliJ, or Visual Studio Code. I found out how to create a new Flutter project, where the Flutter SDK sets up all the necessary files and folders, such as the lib, android, ios, and test folders. I also learned the main building blocks of a Flutter app. By default, Flutter employs Material Design components to craft the user interface, which helps create attractive and consistent designs. The app kicks off with a straightforward main.dart file that starts up the app using the runApp() function. I also learned about was widgets. In Flutter, everything is a widget, from text to buttons to whole screens. I came to understand the difference between StatelessWidgets, which remain unchanged after they are made, and StatefulWidgets, that can change as the app runs. I also learned how to include external packages to improve the app's features, making it more adaptable.Finally, the chapter highlighted the hot reload feature, which lets developers see changes to the code right away in the running app, making the development process much smoother. This chapter gave me a solid introduction to Flutter development, making it easier for me to grasp the basic setup and key elements of a Flutter app.
